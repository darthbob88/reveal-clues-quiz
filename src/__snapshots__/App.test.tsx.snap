        Each question in this quiz will involve a series of increasingly-obvious clues. If you get the question right after the first clue, you get the maximum number of points (4 points if the question has 4 clues, 3 points if it has 3 clues, etc). Each additional clue you need reduces the value by 1 point, down to 1 point if you need all the clues. HOWEVER, you only get one chance to answer, and if you answer wrong, you get 0 points. So it's better to ask for another clue and get 3 points than get a question wrong and get 0 points.

        EG: If you know which US state is home to 
        <a
          href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/widow-jane-mine"
        >
          the Widow Jane Mine
        </a>
        , you get 4 points. If you need another clue, that this state is also home to the 
        <a
          href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jello-gallery-museum"
        >
          JELL-O Gallery Museum
        </a>
         you will get only 3 points for a correct answer. If you need to hear that this state also has the 
        <a
          href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/amityville-horror-house"
        >
          Amityville Horror house
        </a>
        , you only get 2 points. If you can't get the answer until you hear that this state also has the 
        <a
          href="https://www.nps.gov/stli/index.htm"
        >
          Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World
        </a>
        , you only get 1 point.
        <br />
        On the other hand, if you answered wrongly based on any of those clues, you'd only get 0 points.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Only got two quizzes. Looking to get some more, and to add a "Create your own quiz" feature, but for now, two hard-coded quizzes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not accessible enough. I've made an effort to keep things high-contrast, properly keyboard-navigable, and use semantic HTML, but there's probably some other use cases I've missed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Due to programmer laziness, we are not particular about casing, but we only accept one spelling and phrasing. "the sex pistols" is correct, "Sex Pistols" is not.
          </li>
          <li>
            I am deeply unsatisfied with the layout and UI, but don't know enough to fix it properly. Feedback welcome, although I am not budging on the brutalism.
