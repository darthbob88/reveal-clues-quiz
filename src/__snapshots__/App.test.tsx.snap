      Each question in this quiz will involve a series of increasingly-obvious clues. If you get the question right after the first clue, you get the maximum number of points (4 points if the question has 4 clues, 3 points if it has 3 clues, etc). Each additional clue you need reduces the value by 1 point, down to 1 point if you need all the clues. HOWEVER, you only get one chance to answer, and if you answer wrong, you get 0 points. So it's better to ask for another clue and get 3 points than get a question wrong and get 0 points.

      Additionally- Due to programmer laziness, we are not particular about casing, but we are particular about spelling. "the sex pistols" is correct, "Sex Pistols" is not. This is issue #3 to fix, after adding the ability to generate new quizzes.
